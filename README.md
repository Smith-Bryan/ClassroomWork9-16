Chapters 5-9
-Prepcode is a form of pseudo code to help focus on logic
-test code: tests the real deal to see if it works properly
- real code: almost like a final version of the code
- method implementation:
- refactor - to improve
- Interger(1).parseInt(2)
- (1) A class that ships with java
- (2) A method in the integer class that knows how to "parse" a String into the int it represents
- - parse: Analyze sentence or syntax into parts!
- for(int cell : locationCells) {}
  - Laymans terms - repeat for each element in the location cels array:take the next element in the array and assign it to the int variable cell
  - ...The colon (:) means "in" so the whole thing means "for each int value In locationCells"
